            <h2>Five Women’s Dresses Every Wardrobe Must Have</h2>
            <h5>Deepika Sharma, Jan 2, 2022</h5>
            <div class="fakeimg" style="height:400px; align-items: center;">
                <img src="blog2.png">
            </div>
            <p>Dresses have always had a significant impact on a woman’s wardrobe. Even with the evolving trends,  women’s dresses continue to remain a staple in fashion. What sarees are to Indian wear, dresses are to western styles. 

                With that being said, choosing ideal women’s dresses can seem like a daunting task with a plethora of styles and designs available. Hence, we have curated a list of five stylish ladies’ dresses that should be a part of every woman’s wardrobe.<br><br>
                
                <b>1.Sheath Dresses:</b>
                If you are looking for a versatile women’s dress that can be worn to both a formal business event as well as a ladies’ night out, sheath dresses are your best bet. These women’s dresses feature a straight cut with no visible seam. Therefore, they are form-fitting and are even nipped at the waistline. 
                
                Many see this dress as ideal for women with an hourglass figure. It can be worn on its own or be layered with a statement jacket for a boss-lady look.<br><br>
                
                <b>2.Maxi Dresses:</b>
                They are one of the most popular types of women’s dresses known for being chic, comfortable and exquisite. Generally categorised as informal attire, they are fitted at the bust and tend to loosen out towards the hem. 
                
                Ideal for women with an apple or slim silhouette, these designer dresses flow with your figure, giving you the perfect laid-back look. Add a pair of breezy sandals and minimalist necklace to complete the ensemble.<br><br>
                
                <b>3.Midi Dresses:</b>
                As the name suggests, these women’s dresses sit between a maxi and a mini dress. If you are unsure of any event’s formality, pairing them with a cute pair of flats is the way to go.
                
                These women’s dresses come with varying neckline and sleeve length; therefore seen as ideal for tall women with a pear-shaped silhouette. Midi dresses can either be worn on their own or be matched with complimenting tights and ankle-length boots for a perfect winter look.<br>
                
                <b>4.Mini Dresses:</b>
                If you are someone who likes to keep edgy, mini dresses are what you need. They are snug-fitting apparels that usually end above the knees. 
                
                A big hit among short women with a petite shape, these women’s dresses can be the go-to outfits for casual outings or date nights. Complete the ensemble by throwing a pair of gorgeous pumps into the mix.<br><br>
                
                <b>5.A-Line Dresses:</b>
                This women’s dress fits snugly at the hips and flares down the hem giving an A-line shape. The primary reason it enjoys such popularity is that it can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. While sporting this women’s dress, you can team it up with tan stilettos or choose a sporty look with classic white sneakers.
